# Word2Vec-Application

Word2vec is a two-layer neural net that processes text by vectorizing words. Its input is a text corpus,  and its output is a set of vectors: feature vectors that represent words in that corpus. While Word2vec is not a deep neural network, it turns text into a numerical form that deep neural networks can understand.
